    <h2>History & Construction</h2>
    <p>
        The mausoleum was constructed between 1668 and 1669. 
        The total cost of construction was around Rs. 6,68,203. 
        Marble was brought from Jaipur. 
        Though inspired by the Taj Mahal, it has its own unique 
        architectural beauty and historical importance.
