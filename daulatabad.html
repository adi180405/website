    <h2>Architecture & History</h2>

    <p>
        The fort stands on a 200-meter-high conical hill with vertical
        carved rock walls to prevent climbing. It has only one entrance,
        curved pathways, false doors, and spike-studded gates designed
        to confuse enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The famous <strong>Chand Minar</strong> was built by Bahmani ruler
        Hasan Gangu. The fort was later controlled by the
        Ahmadnagar Sultanate, the Mughals, and the Marathas.
        Today, it is one of Maharashtra’s most important historical monuments.
